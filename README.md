Lead Scoring Case Study Summary
Problem Statement
● X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses
on several websites and search engines like Google.
● X Education gets a lot of leads, but its lead conversion rate is very poor. The typical lead
conversion rate at X education is around 30%. In order to increase the lead conversion
process more efficiently, the company wishes to identify the potential leads, who can be
categorized as ‘Hot Leads’.
● Once ‘Hot Leads’ are acquired, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will
now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls
to everyone.
Business Goal:
● X Education needs help in selecting the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most
likely to convert into paying customers.
● The company wants to build a model to identify Hot Leads.
● Improve the lead conversion rate from 30% to 80%
